<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Hangman in Ruby** is a robust interactive system engineered to demonstrate the elegance and efficiency of Ruby's object-oriented architecture. By bridging the gap between foundational algorithms and tactile terminal-based gaming, this repository provides a comprehensive study into systematic software engineering and logical state orchestration.

The application serves as a digital exploration of game theory and responsive console interaction, structured into modular components that ensure maintainability and high-performance execution directly within the shell environment.
<br><br>
This project was developed as a distinctive milestone during the **[30-Day Ruby Challenge](https://amey-thakur.github.io/RUBY/)**, a collaborative engineering sprint undertaken by **Amey Thakur** and **Mega Satish**. It represents the practical synthesis of concepts explored in the comprehensive **[Ruby Repository](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/RUBY)**, demonstrating the transition from theoretical study to production-grade implementation.

### Engineering Heuristics
The interaction model is governed by strict **computational design patterns** ensuring fidelity and responsiveness:
*   **Modular Orchestration**: The system utilizes a specialized class hierarchy (Board, Game, Display) for complex logic separation, providing a tactile confirmation for every user action.
*   **State Integrity**: Beyond simple arrays, the system integrates a validation engine that dynamically verifies every move, reinforcing the deterministic narrative of the gameplay.
*   **Tactile Feedback**: Real-time terminal rendering ensures the mission docket remains synchronized, maintaining a zero-latency bridge between raw user input and visual board updates.

> [!TIP]
> **Logic-Driven Interaction**
>
> To maximize user engagement, the system employs a **multi-stage validation system**. **Visual board vectors** visualize the current state, and **deterministic win-check algorithms** provide immediate feedback, strictly coupling player goals with state changes. This ensures the user's mental model is constantly synchronized with the underlying game trajectory.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tactile Interaction** | Implements **Real-Time Terminal Feedback** for intuitive and high-impact move placement. |
| **Modular OOP** | Custom **Class-Based Architecture** ensuring clean separation of data and logic. |
| **Logic Verification** | Robust **State-Based Validation** ensuring mission data survives invalid input events. |
| **Cinematic Playback** | A deterministic **Game Setup Sequence** that ensures assets are synchronized before interaction. |
| **Dynamic Turn-Taking** | Integrated **Game Orchestration Engine** for visual and structural turn classification. |
| **Victory Detection** | **High-Fidelity Algorithmic Scanners** that celebrate mission completion milestones. |
| **Zero-Latency Web Runtime** | Deployed via **WebAssembly (WASM)** with **Fiber-based non-blocking I/O** for a native console feel in the browser. |
